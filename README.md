Project-2
=========

This is project 2

This project will
1.
Modify the MINIX 3 scheduler to keep track of how much CPU time each user process has had recently.

2.
Change the scheduling mechanism for user processes. When no system task or server wants to run, pick the user process that has had the smallest share of the CPU.
